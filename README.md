# pep-bootstrap4-sidebar-framework

A bare bones Bootstrap 4 only starter framework for a PEP-Web design.  Intended to give PEP-Web Development teams a prototyping starting base, if they want.
 
Includes "dummy" data as placeholders.
 
## Technical Problems Noted but not addressed

1. The scroll area doesn't work correctly when text overflows in the y direction, text continues beyond the footer  There are two scroll bars that show. 
2. Heading font sizes, and font sizes in general aren't idea nor the most attractive they could be
3. The dropdown triangle for the user menu is not showing currently due to a styling issue
4. CSS may have unused (abandoned) styles as the quick template development progressed 

## Base list of Changes Needed      
 
1. In some places it would be better to use select fields instead of the list dropdowns that were used.
2. For text content, it might be better to use scrolls for each of the content areas
3. There should be a button to hide Related Info
4. Very little to no effort was put into styling.  It needs it.
5. The Related Info sidebar might be better as a hideable fixed area like the left navbar.  Then responsive behavior would be better.
6. Needs a preferences dialog
